# MOS AMPLIFIERS
This repository contains a collection of codes which will help in understanding of MOSFET amplifiers.
# PREREQUISITES
THEORY:

Basic understanding of Circuit Theory and Analog Electronics is needed.

TOOLS:

The intended reader should have some familarity with EDA tools(SPICE). 
Since this is done in an linux environment , familiarity with linux is recommended.

# NG SPICE installation:

Installation in ubuntu:
<br/>1.sudo apt-get update
<br/>2.sudo apt-get install ngspice

# GETTING STARTED:

<br/>Type the following in terminal:
<br/>cd
<br/> <Now you are in the home directory.>
<br/>Create a separate folder for circuits and inside it create a separate forder for sub circuit files and library files.
